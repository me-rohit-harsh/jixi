                    <p>For a Product or a Service to be canceled by our customers, a proper cancellation request must be

                        from within the Client Dashboard or the customer should submit a Cancellation ticket explaining
                        the reason for the cancellation in our Billing Department.</p>
                    <p>The customer agrees and acknowledges that there are exactly two types of service cancellation
                        depending on the period chosen by the customer in their Cancellation Request:</p>
                    <p>The customer acknowledges and agrees that JiXiCloud will not keep a copy of the Shared/Cloud Web
                        Hosting account after the cancellation request becomes active and the Product or Service is
                        canceled. That includes the whole Shared Web Hosting account as well as any backups generated
                        for the same to be restored.</p>
                    <p>For VPS or Dedicated Server services, the data will be kept for no more than 24 hours after the
                        cancellation of service become effective. After that period the whole server will be removed
                        meaning that all data hosted on the same will be permanently deleted with no option for the same

                        before committing to the complete termination of service.</p>
                    <p><strong>This means that we will open a Support Case with a complete description of the violated
                            terms and give our customers respectful time to resolve the outstanding case:</strong></p>
                    <p>7 days for our Shared Web Hosting products. 3 days for our VPS and Dedicated Servers products.
                        The period starts immediately after a case is being open in our ticketing system. The customer
                        is solely responsible for being aware of the case as well as for resolving the case according to
                        the provided time frame.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the cancellation takes place JiXiCloud will provide a backup archive to the
                        customer containing all customer data hosted on the canceled/terminated service. The backup
                        archive will be available for 7 calendar days after the same is made available for download. It
                        is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the backup archive is being downloaded
                        completely within the timeframe given by JiXiCloud.</p>
                    <p>In case the reason for the cancellation of service by JiXiCloud is different than a Terms of
                        Service violation by the customer, JiXiCloud will issue a prorated partial refund for the
                        remaining months of service the Web Hosting product or service has been prepaid for. The amount
                        of the refund is calculated on the following basis: the full prepaid amount minus the remaining
                        months of service multiplied by the price per month of the canceled service.</p>
                    <p>JiXiCloud will provide a few options for the customer to choose from when it comes to receiving a

                        automatically sent to our customer’s PayPal account.</p>

                            word or 3-5 letters. They are also known as "aftermarket" or "pre-registered" domains. Most
                            premium domains have a
